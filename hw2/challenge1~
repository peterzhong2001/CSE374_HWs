1. echo: echo 'LuxSit'
   I used the echo command to directly echo the text into the terminal.
   
2. cat: echo 'LuxSit' > LuxSit
   	cat LuxSit
   I first created a file named LuxSit that contains 'LuxSit'. Then,
   I used the cat command to read the content of that file.

3. ls: ls LuxSit
   I directly used ls to list the name of the previously created file
   named LuxSit.

4. grep: grep 'LuxSit' LuxSit
   I used grep to find the test 'LuxSit' within the previously created
   file named LuxSit.

5. !!: alias LuxSit=''
       LuxSit
       !!
   I firrst created an alias named LuxSit that does absolutely nothing
   when it is called. Then, I called LuxSit, and used !! to display the
   last called command.
