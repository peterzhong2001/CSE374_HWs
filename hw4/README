1. Description of My Project:
	This is a C program that counts the number of a certain letter in multiple
text files.Upon successful execution, the program will print out how many times the
letter has appeared in total in the text files passed in the argument.

2. Command for compiling my code: gcc -Wall -std=c11 -g -o countLetter countLetter.c

3. Technical Directions:
	After compiling and outputting to countLetter, it should be called in the
following format:

	./countLetter [letter] [file1] [file2] ...
	
	One and only one letter argument should be passed. At least one filename
argument should be passed. If not enough arguments are passed, the program will 
print out an error message and exit.
	[letter]: the letter to be searched. The argument should only be a single
letter. Otherwise, the program will print out an error message and exit. 
	[file]: filenames of files to be inspected. When a file cannot be opened, 
the program will print out corresponding messages in the command window and continue
executing normally.
