1. List of commands:
   getcourses: echo, exit, grep, sed, sort, cp, rm
   perform-measurement: echo, exit, mktemp, wget, grep, sed, cat, rm
   run-analysis: mktemp, echo, grep, rm, exit


2. Design decisions

   getcourses: I have decided to include all urls that includes the pattern
   	       "courses/", since all of these urls are CSE course websites
	       hosted on courses.cs.washington.edu. I also decided to delete
	       the "csep" courses, since they are for the PMP program. I also     		       
	       included an additional step to process the degenerate link of CSE 		       
	       578, a special url that does not end with a forward slash.

   perform-measurement: Instead of using the wc command to count the byte size
			of the html file, I used sed to process the information
			outputted by the wget command. I also redirected the
			html download of the wget command to /dev/null to avoid
			clogging up the entire directory with html files.

   run-analysis: I added an argument check at the beginning of the script to 
		 make sure that the number of arguments passed into the script
		 is correct. I also implemented a warning message when the output
		 filename already exists.


3. Trend in the scatterplot:
	The course websites average at around 20k-30k bytes in size. Most of the
	course websites are sized under 50k bytes. Only two courses goes above
	100k bytes. No solid conclusion can be drawn for the relationship between
	the size of the website and ease of navigation, since the term "ease of
	navigation" is not defined and will require further research and scripting
	to quantify. Regardless, since most of the websites are on the lower end
	of the size spectrum, it can be generally assumed that the ease of
	navigation of the websites are not related to their size.

4. The number that the R script prints out: 
	20797.53 bytes is the average size of all the course websites that are
	being analyzed.
