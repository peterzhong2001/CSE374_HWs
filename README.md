# CSE374_HWs

This is a collection of the Bash script / C / C++ code that I have written for my CSE 374 "Intermediate Programming Concepts And Tools" class. I took this class at the University of Washington during spring quarter 2021 with Prof. Megan Hazen. I worked on HW 1-4 and HW7 alone, and collaborated with Ariel Luo on the completion of HW 4-5. Please refer to the [assignment specs page for CSE 374 21sp](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse374/21sp/assignments/) for a comprehensive introduction to each of the HWs.
